*********************
Project Goals:
*********************
  - Demonstrate and implement knowledge of object-oriented programming using C++
  - Development of software using version-control software (Git)
  - Documentation and planning of development using UML
  
*********************
Hardware Used:
*********************
  - Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPi-3)
  - Panasonic GridEYE imaging device (PGE) (custom imaging device developed by Grant Hilgert for use with RPi-3)

The PGE was developed by Grant Hilgert for use with the RPi-3.

*********************
Development Platform:
*********************
The Data Processing Application (PGE-DPA) was developed using Xcode on macOS High Sierra (ver. 10.13.2), using a template
that assists in the development and generation of a windowed program using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).

SFML is a cross-language, multi-platform API that assists in the creation of executable applications for use on multiple platforms.

*************************************
Requirements for program compilation:
*************************************
  - RPi-3
  - PGE
  - Installation of wiringPi library on RPi-3
